This project offers an example to utilize the hardware multicast
facility via regular load/stores of the Adapteva Epiphany accelerator.
To this, faster methods are available, which can read the status,
config and timer registers without any overhead of method calling
(compared to the default epiphany library).
Last, an barrier was implemented, able to utilize the hardware barrier
capability.

Contains:
- light-weight implementation of the hardware barrier
- light-weight inline-methods for the config/status/counter registers
- ... and as descriped, the support of the multicast

Mayor issue:
- The hardware multicast can only be issued by the cores of the first
  column (0, 1, 2, 3), otherwise a hardware bug is triggered, leading
  to a freeze of the application! This is a known issue of the Epiphany
  III chip.
