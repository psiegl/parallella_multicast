This project offers an example to utilize the hardware multicast facility via regular load/stores of the Adapteva Epiphany accelerator.
To this, faster methods are available, which can read the status, config and timer registers without any overhead of method calling (compared to the default epiphany library).
Last, an barrier was implemented, able to utilize the hardware barrier capability.

Minor issue:
- The example is optimized for the 16 core version, but can also be modified to run on the 64 core variant (see config_t.h)

Mayor issue:
- The hardware multicast can only be issued by the cores of the first column (0, 1, 2, 3), otherwise a hardware bug is triggered, leading to a freeze of the application! This is a known issue of the Epiphany III chip.
